# What's with the name ?

Magrathea is an ancient planet located in orbit around the twin suns Soulianis and Rahm in the
heart of the Horsehead Nebula.

It was the Magratheans who constructed the planet-sized computer named Earth (for a race of hyperintelligent
pandimensional beings, the mice) to determine the ultimate question of Life, the Universe, and Everything,
which is required to understand the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.
